Desktop App - Wellness Game for Citrus Hack 2021

# Tools Used 
- Github
- Unity

# Purpose of Game
We want to create a fun game that encourages people to take care of themselves. The two things we focus on iss to help people drink enough water and and get enought sleep. The more consistent and adequate amount of sleep a person gets the more animals a person will get in their imaginary farm. To ensure that their animals are healthy they must log in the amount of water they are drinking. We hope that this helps people take the time to make sure that they are hydrated and sleeping enough by seeing the effects of not doing so on imaginary farm animals.

# Project Story

# Compiling the Game
The game is made using Unity3D engine. It should load normally like a unity game, however, the repo does not have the Library folder so it may not work.

# Running the Game
Currently, the available build only runs on Windows. To install it, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/sbala025/WellnessGame/releases/latest), and downloaded `WellnessGame.zip` and extract the zip file. In the extracted folder, enter the `Demo_2` folder and run `WellnessGame.exe`. You may have to allow your computer to run the exe file from an unverified publisher.
