# Wellness Game
Desktop App - Wellness Game for Citrus Hack 2021

# Tools Used 
- Github
- Unity

# Purpose of Game
We want to create a fun game that encourages people to take care of themselves. The two things we focus on iss to help people drink enough water and and get enought sleep. The more consistent and adequate amount of sleep a person gets the more animals a person will get in their imaginary farm. To ensure that their animals are healthy they must log in the amount of water they are drinking. We hope that this helps people take the time to make sure that they are hydrated and sleeping enough by seeing the effects of not doing so on imaginary farm animals.

# Project Story
